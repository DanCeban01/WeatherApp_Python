This project main goal is to consolidate the knowledge of usage of API's in Python.

So, to start write in terminal `python weather.py` and if all the packages are installed and downloaded properly it should give you the option to select the city. After if the conection to API is good you should get similar response to mine:

``` Python
Enter a location: New York
Weather in New York
Time: 2023-07-13 13:01:20
Main weather: Clouds
Description: scattered clouds
Temperature: 23.37 Â°C
Humidity: 76 %
```

And that is all this programm do for now.
